The documentary revolves around the NSA whistle-blower, **Edward Snowden**, who was accused of leaking NSA’s sensitive documents to the media in 2013. It has several moments where the actor is shown having a sense of confusion in between choosing to conduct surveillance within ethical/lawful rights and crossing them for the sake of patriotism and preventing state terrorism. But what baffles me is how the state masks unlawful activities behind the same slogan – and that only begs the question, to what extents are our laws being broken?

When the actor felt personal boundaries being crossed – he took the action. So, whether or not, you’re against or in favor of being spied on – it’s when it befalls you, when you’ll be making the final decision. That is when you’ll actually be answering the question and standing up for your own personal rights to freedom of usage!

One other take from this movie is how vulnerable organizations are to insider threats. If measures aren’t in place, you’re prone to breaches/leakage, and that can be quite harmful – especially considering how well-reputed this very ‘Secret Agency’ is/was.

Lastly, it also raises a question as to where we stand. If an agency can tap phones, monitor web cams, and spy on people – that’s a capability they’ve mastered. What we lack is the talent to showcase such magnificent display of technical expertise.
