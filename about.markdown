### Hi there,

**"A professional writer is an amateur who didnâ€™t quit."** - Richard Bach

I'm the amateur in discussion here; managing to find my way through slim alleys and dim lights. I'm a writer, born, raised, and based in Karachi (and I've never managed to step my foot out). This blog is all about the knowledge I've come around to as I progress in my journy as a Security Engineer.

Professional life aside, I enjoy sarcasm, heavy-metal music, and movies that would certainly turn your opinions sour about me. On the phone, I might sound phony... is it too late to salvage your opinion? 

Jokes apart, I'm an undergraduate student with a knack for write-ups, and the heart of a cheerful kid with ambitions as high as the sky!

Get in touch with me on any of my socials; you won't be disappointed.
